# Machine learning projects
A comparative study of machine learning models for customer segmentation and price prediction in the retail industry.

My objectives are:
1. To what extent can clustering algorithms determine customer groups.
2. To what extent can regression algorithms predict the price of diamonds based on their features in order to optimize selling price.
3. To what extent can regression algorithms predict the end prices of online auction items to optimize price points.

To achieve my first objective, I explored the UCI online retail dataset to see if there are any discernible patterns or segments in the demographics of their customers. Customer segmentation is useful to understand customer demographics and for deriving insights that influence customer behaviour to help develop marketing strategies that best serve a particular demographic. I compared k-means and hierachical clustering algorithms. 
Access to the dataset can be found here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail/.

For the second objective, I compared linear and support vector regression to analyse diamond by their prices, cut and other attributes. Dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds.

For the third objective, I compared linear regression and decision trees to forcast end prices of online auction items. Dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/onlineauctions/online-auctions-dataset.

Results.
The various machine learning algorithms have shown that they can provide useful information to businesses and experts alike.
K-means outperformed Hierarchical clustering in segmenting customers.
SVR is more robust than linear regression in predicting diamond prices.
Regression tree outperformed linear regression in predicting end-price of auction items.
